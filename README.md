## CanChat

CanChat is a simple chat platform built using Python sockets and deployed over heroku.

### Inspiration behind CanChat

CanChat came about as a Coding challenge.

While deciding the Direction I wanted to take with it I realized I wanted to
keep it as lightweight as possible, and also as 'retro' as possible.

With CanChat you can chat just like they do in those Hacker-movies.

## UPDATE
Deploying on Heroku with this version seems to be a no go due to their internal routing

we can connect through
> telnet URL 443

but... this does not persist

Ngrok might work though.
